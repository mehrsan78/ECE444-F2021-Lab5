## Activity 6

The results table was difficult to understand in the old UI because there were no dividers between the cells. In the new UI, the borders help the user to distinguish the information between the cells easier. In addition, it is easier to tell what each column is representing, by center-aligning the headers in the new UI vs the right-alignment of the older version.
